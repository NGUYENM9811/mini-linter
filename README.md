# mini-linter
n this project, you will use what you know about iterating over arrays to improve the quality of a paragraph and gather some information about that paragraph.

This is the same type of work that word processing software does. Additionally, you may have heard of linting, a process by which text is evaluated and improved by an application. In this project, you will create a miniature version of a linter using array methods that you have learned. 

<b>Requirements</b> :
<br>
<ol>

<li>In the code editor, there is a string called <b>story</b>. We want to gather some information about the individual words and sentences in the string. Letâ€™s split the string into individual words and save them in a new array called <b>storyWords</b> </li>

<li>There is an array of words that are unnecessary. Iterate over your array to filter out these words. Save the remaining words in an array called <b>betterWords</b>. There are several ways that you could achieve this.</li>

</ol>
